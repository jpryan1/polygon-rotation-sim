Error: impacting vertex approaching from outside polygon.
Here is my guess - you are using CoR<1 and your system lost all its energy
This is an event driven simulation, which will NOT accept a polygon "sitting" on the wall
Check the animation to see if it is snaking. Here are the angular velocities:
